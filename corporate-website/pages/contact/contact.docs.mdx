## Component usage

Use the component to create a contact page for your website. It includes a contact form and company information.

```jsx
<Contact />
```
### Basic Contact Form
This example shows the basic usage of the Contact component. It renders a contact form with fields for name, email, phone, subject, and message, along with company contact information.
```jsx
<Contact />
```
### Contact Form with Custom Information
This example demonstrates how to customize the contact information displayed on the page, such as office address, contact phone, contact email, and map image.
```jsx
<Contact
  officeAddress="Mars Research Outpost Alpha, Valles Marineris Sector, Mars"
  contactPhone="+MARS-OUTPOST-ALPHA-COMMS"
  contactEmail="alpha.operations@corporateinc.mars"

/>
```
### Contact Form with Inquiry Submission Handling
This example illustrates how to handle form submissions.  The `onSubmitForm` prop is used to pass a function that will be called when the form is submitted.  In this example, the form data is displayed in an alert.
```jsx
() => {
  const handleMarsMissionInquiry = (formData) => {
    const submissionDetails = `
      New Mars Mission Inquiry:
      --------------------------
      Name: ${formData.firstName} ${formData.lastName}
      Email: ${formData.email}
      Phone: ${formData.phone || 'Not provided'}
      Subject: ${formData.subject}
      Message: 
      ${formData.message}
      --------------------------
      (Simulated submission - data not actually sent)
    `;
    alert(submissionDetails);
  };
  return <Contact onSubmitForm={handleMarsMissionInquiry} />;
}
