## Basic Usage

The `Services` component displays a set of cards, each representing a service offered by Corporate Inc. It includes a title, subtitle, and a grid of service cards with images and descriptions.

```jsx
<Services />
```
## Custom Title and Subtitle
You can customize the title and subtitle of the `Services` section to better reflect the specific content being presented.
```jsx
<Services
  title="Our Advanced Martian Offerings"
  subtitle="Explore Corporate Inc.'s specialized solutions for conquering the Red Planet and establishing a thriving new world."
/>
```
## Themed Background
The `Services` component can be rendered with a themed background using the `background` prop. This example uses the `tertiary` background, providing a space-themed gradient.
```jsx
<Services
  title="Services in the Stars"
  subtitle="Our vision extends to the cosmos, reflected in our advanced service offerings."
  background="tertiary"
/>
