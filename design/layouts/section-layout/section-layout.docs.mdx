## Basic Usage

The `SectionLayout` component is designed to structure content sections on a webpage, providing consistent styling and layout.

```jsx
<SectionLayout
  title="Section Title"
  subtitle="A brief description of the section's content."
>
  <div>Content of the section goes here.</div>
</SectionLayout>
```
This example demonstrates the basic usage of the `SectionLayout` component with a title, subtitle, and some content.
## Centered Alignment
You can center the content within the `SectionLayout` by using the `alignment` prop.
```jsx
<SectionLayout
  title="Centered Title"
  subtitle="This section's content is centered."
  alignment="center"
>
  <div>Centered Content</div>
</SectionLayout>
```
Setting `alignment` to `"center"` will apply the appropriate styles to center the title, subtitle, and content.
## Full Width Section
To create a section that spans the full width of the screen, use the `fullWidth` prop.
```jsx
<SectionLayout
  title="Full Width Section"
  subtitle="This section stretches across the entire screen."
  fullWidth={true}
>
  <div>Full Width Content</div>
</SectionLayout>
```
Setting `fullWidth` to `true` will remove the maximum width constraint, allowing the section to fill the screen.
