The `Flex` component provides a flexible and efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic.

## Basic Row Flex

This example demonstrates the default behavior of the `Flex` component, which arranges items in a row.

```jsx
<Flex>
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</Flex>
```
## Column Flex with Gap and Alignment
This example shows how to use the `direction`, `gap`, and `align` props to create a column layout with a medium gap between items and center alignment.
```jsx
<Flex direction="column" gap="medium" align="center">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</Flex>
```
## Justify Content Space Between
This example demonstrates how to use the `justify` prop to distribute space between items in a row, pushing the first item to the start and the last item to the end of the container.
```jsx
<Flex justify="space-between">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</Flex>
