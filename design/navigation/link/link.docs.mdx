## Link Component

The `Link` component is designed for seamless navigation within Corporate Inc.'s website and to external resources. It supports both internal routing using `react-router-dom` and standard external links.

## Internal Links

To create an internal link, simply provide a `href` that corresponds to a route within your React Router setup.

```jsx
<Link href="/careers">
  Explore Career Opportunities
</Link>
```
This will render a link that navigates the user to the `/careers` route within the application.
## External Links
For linking to external websites, set the `external` prop to `true` and provide the full URL in the `href` prop.
```jsx
<Link href="https://www.nasa.gov" external>
  Visit NASA
</Link>
```
This configuration automatically sets `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for security and proper handling of external links.
## Custom Styling
You can apply custom styles to the `Link` component using the `className` prop.
```jsx
<Link href="/special-offer" className="highlight-link">
  Check Out Our Special Offer!
</Link>
```
Ensure that the class `highlight-link` is defined in your CSS or SCSS modules and imported appropriately.
