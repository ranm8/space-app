The `Paragraph` component is designed to provide consistent and readable typography across Corporate Inc.'s website. It supports different sizes and can be rendered as various HTML elements.

## Basic Usage

The most straightforward use of the `Paragraph` component involves wrapping your text content within it. This ensures that the text adheres to the established typographic styles of the website.

```jsx
<Paragraph>
  Corporate Inc. is dedicated to advancing space technology and making humanity a multi-planetary species.
</Paragraph>
```
## Size Variations
The component offers different size options to accommodate various design needs. You can use the `size` prop to specify the desired size, such as `large` for increased prominence or `small` for less emphasized text.
```jsx
<Paragraph size="large">
  Our vision for Mars is ambitious yet achievable. We are developing advanced propulsion systems and life support technologies.
</Paragraph>
```
## Custom Element Type
You can also change the underlying HTML element rendered by the `Paragraph` component. By default, it renders as a `<p>` element, but you can use the `element` prop to render it as a `<div>` or `<span>`, allowing for greater flexibility in layout and styling.
```jsx
<Paragraph element="div">
  Join us on this historic journey as we explore and develop sustainable solutions for Martian colonization.
</Paragraph>
