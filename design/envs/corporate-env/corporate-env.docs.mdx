A reusable development environment for React components at Corporate Inc.
This environment is configured to support the development of modern, high-tech user interfaces for our space technology initiatives, including our vision to populate Mars.
It integrates the Corporate Theme for consistent branding and provides a suite of development tools.

Features:
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è TypeScript for robust and maintainable code.
- üß™ Vitest for fast and efficient unit and component testing.
- üé® Integration with `@corporate/design.corporate-theme` for consistent styling and theming across all components.
- üßë‚Äçüíª Generator templates for React UI components, hooks, and applications.
- üöÄ Optimized build pipeline for React applications.
- ü¶ã ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
- üëì Component previews configured with the Corporate Theme.

## Use in existing workspaces

Add this development environment to your `workspace.jsonc` file to make its generators available:

```json
{
  "teambit.generator/generator": {
    "envs": [
      "my-org.my-scope/corporate-env"
    ]
  }
}
```
Replace `my-org.my-scope` with the actual scope where this environment component is hosted.
You can then see the available generator templates using `bit templates`.
## Use on an existing component
To apply this environment to an existing component, run the following command:
```shell
bit env set your-component-name my-org.my-scope/corporate-env
```
## Create a new React workspace based on this environment
You can create a new React workspace scaffolded with this environment using:
```shell
bit new react my-corporate-workspace --aspect my-org.my-scope/corporate-env
```
## Customizing this Environment
This environment can be extended or customized. To create your own environment based on this one:
```shell
bit create react-env my-custom-corporate-env --scope your-scope-name
```
In your new environment file (e.g., `my-custom-corporate-env.bit-env.ts`), ensure your class extends `CorporateEnv`:
```typescript
import { CorporateEnv } from '@my-org/my-scope.corporate-env'; // Adjust import path
export class MyCustomCorporateEnv extends CorporateEnv {
  name = 'my-custom-corporate-env';
  // Override methods or properties as needed
  // For example, to change the ESLint configuration:
  // protected eslintConfigPath = require.resolve('./config/my-custom-eslint.cjs');
}
export default new MyCustomCorporateEnv();
```
This allows you to inherit the base configurations for Corporate Inc. while tailoring specific aspects to different project needs.
