## Basic Card

The most basic usage of the `Card` component involves wrapping content within it. You can also provide a title to give the card a clear heading.

```jsx
<Card title="Our Martian Vision">
  Corporate Inc. is dedicated to establishing the first sustainable human colony on Mars. This card outlines our primary goals for pioneering a new frontier.
</Card>
```
## Card with Image and Footer
This example demonstrates how to include an image and a footer within the `Card`. The image is displayed at the top, and the footer at the bottom, providing additional context or actions.
```jsx
<Card
  title="Titan V Launch System"
  image="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1541185933-ef5d8ed016c2?ixid=M3w3MDc2NDF8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHw1fHxzcGFjZSUyMHRlY2hub2xvZ3klMkMlMjBmdXR1cmlzdGljfGVufDF8MHx8Ymx1ZXwxNzQ3MjIzMTQ1fDA&ixlib=rb-4.1.0"
  imageAlt="Titan V rocket launching towards Mars"
  footer={<span style={{ fontSize: 'var(--typography-sizes-body-small)', color: 'var(--colors-text-tertiary)'}}>Status: Final Testing Phase</span>}
>
  The Titan V is our next-generation heavy-lift launch vehicle, designed for interplanetary missions to Mars. It features reusable boosters and advanced cryogenic engines.
</Card>
```
## Interactive Card
Make a card interactive by setting the `interactive` prop to true and providing an `onClick` function. This example shows a card that alerts a message when clicked.
```jsx
<Card
  title="Explore Our Technologies"
